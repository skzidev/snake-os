Keyboard.h; The keyboard Driver

This is a non-interrupt based PS/2 keyboard driver.

Non-interrupt based because I haven't set up an IDT yet.

todo list:

TODO: Code is unable to recognize key-presses. Fix this madness.

Also if you want to learn more about this, I two resources that helped a lot.
