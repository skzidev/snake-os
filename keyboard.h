/*

Keyboard.h; The keyboard Driver

This is a non-interrupt based PS/2 keyboard driver.

Non-interrupt based because I haven't set up an IDT yet.

todo list:

TODO: Add USB Keyboard support.

The reason I'm not doing this out of the box is because of 2 reasons

1. I want to learn how PS/2 works
2. Lots of laptops use PS/2 to connect their keyboards internally,
and I'm planning on seeing if I can run this OS on an old laptop I have.
