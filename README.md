Snake is fun enough to keep away boredom while still being very simple.

I thought I might as well challenge myself this summer and decided to write an OS.

### Progress So far

- [x] Working Bootloader
- [x] Working Kernel
- [x] Working VGA Driver
- [ ] Working Keyboard Driver (PS2)
- [ ] Game Graphics and Logic
- [ ] Working Sound Driver
- [ ] Real-Metal Ready

### Building

Build to a `.bin` file, with the directions below.

Then, Boot up Rufus or ImgBurn to burn to a boot medium.

Or, you can run it in a VM with QEMU.

###### Required software

- Qemu x86 Emulator (If running in a VM, Can be substitued if it can boot .bin files.)
- Rufus or ImgBurn  (If booting from PC)
- GCC and LD
- NASM

###### Building the code

Make 2 folders, `bin` and `obj`

On systems with BASH, use the build script provided in the repo.

`./build.sh`

It should build to a .bin file and load up QEMU by default

### Error Codes

There are a couple error messages that may show if the code fails to properly boot or play.
(Similar to below).
Below the Error message there may also be a brief explaination of the problem at hand.
(If it occured in the bootloader stage, Otherwise, it might not.)

The first 2 take place when the OS is in its bootloader stage.
All other error codes added will be in the kernel stage.

```
Err {number}
```

1. Failed to load kernel into memory. Most likely a compilation (or flashing if on real hardware) issue
2. Drive in an unreadable status (see [Disk Status](https://stanislavs.org/helppc/int_13-1.html))
3. Keyboard is not attached to the computer at startup. Restart when attached.
